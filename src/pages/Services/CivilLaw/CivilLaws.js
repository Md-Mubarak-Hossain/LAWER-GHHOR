                <p>Property registration refers to the recording of the property document details in the Registrarâ€™s office and preserving the original documents with the Registering officer. To ensure conservation of the evidence, assurance of title, publicity of documents and prevention of fraud, some documents are obligatorily registered. It is very important that each document has to be presented at the registrar office by the concerned person itself or the authorized person followed by a witness and the implied registration fee.</p>
